#### Goal

Try to kill as many monsters as possible, and survive as long as you can.

Monsters can't see you, but they can hear you, so don't get too close. Luckily for you, picking up a soul bomb slows your perception of time, so you'll have an easier time aiming them!

Good luck!

#### Some Cool Things We Did
* The game is very modular, meaning that it can be turned into a very different-feeling game in about a minute of coding
* Enemies are smart but can still be overcome- they'd run from the closest-to-explosion bomb they hear but would risk their life and ignore all bombs if they hear the player
